Dynamid is a research team focused on dynamid software and distributed systems.

We are part of the [CITI Laboratory](http://www.citi-lab.fr/) at [INSA Lyon](http://www.insa-lyon.fr/), France.

## Our research

#### Dynamic Environments

Several environments are emerging, all with *high dynamic properties*: 

* Internet of Things - with e.g. *the dynamic discovery and adaptation to different hardware*
* Smart Cities - with e.g. *the dynamic trafic and energy management*
* Smart Buildings and Houses - with e.g. *the dynamic user-adapted light and heating control*
* Vehicular Networks - with e.g. *the dynamic, autonomic driveless guidance*
* Mobile Cloud Computing - with e.g. *the dynamic provisioning and load-balancing service management*.

#### Hot Research Topics

We focus on designing [Integrated Software Systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_integration), especially [System of Systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_systems) and [Middleware](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleware), including specific programming languages, operating systems, virtual machines, service-oriented architectures, distributed systems to tackle at runtime the dynamic nature of these environments.
Our software development process and platforms particularly focus on two major issues:

* Adaptive in the Small
  * Context-aware Domain Specific Languages
    * Context-aware Primitives
    * User Profiling and Adapting
    * Heterogeneous Hardware / Software-specialization
  * Adaptive Virtual Machines
    * Performant
    * Multi-tenant
    * Embedded
    * Run-time Evolving
* Autonomous and Collaborative in the Large
  * Autonomous Distributed Architectures and Algorithms
    * Self-organizing
    * Collaborative
    * Scalable
    * Long-life Living
  * Distributed Decision and Artificial Intelligence
    * Optimization and Planning
    * Autonomous Multi-Agent Systems
    * Bio-inspired algorithms
    * Distributed Consensus
  * Autonomous and Resilient Systems
    * Spontaneous Integration
    * Formal Description Discovery 
    * Run-time Checking, Monitoring, Negotiation, Substitution
    * Self-healing
